# Journey to the Depths

## The Story

You are Captain Marcus Thorne, a veteran submariner who once commanded the most advanced deep-sea research vessel ever built. Years ago, you discovered something beneath the waves that was never meant to be found—the hidden kingdom of Atlantis, ruled by the corrupt King Poseidon.

When you reported your discovery, Poseidon saw you as a threat to his underwater dominion. In a single night of terror, his forces struck the surface world where you had docked. Your family was slaughtered as a warning, and your loyal crew was hunted down one by one. The attack was swift, merciless, and left you with nothing but grief and rage.

You survived only by chance, washing up on a distant shore with nothing but the clothes on your back and your lifetime of maritime experience. Your advanced submarine—the *Abyssal Runner*—remains abandoned at an old oil rig far from shore, the last remnant of your former life.

Now, broke and broken, you must rebuild from nothing. Earn enough money to buy a boat. Reach your submarine. Descend into the depths. And make Poseidon pay for everything he's taken from you.

## Gameplay

Starting with nothing on the surface, you must:
- Work odd jobs to earn money for a boat
- Navigate to the abandoned oil rig to reclaim your submarine
- Descend through increasingly dangerous ocean depths
- Battle Atlantean forces and sea creatures
- Confront King Poseidon and exact your revenge

The deeper you go, the darker it gets—and the more dangerous your enemies become.

*The ocean holds many secrets. Some should never be disturbed. But when everything has been taken from you, there's nothing left to fear—only vengeance to claim.*
